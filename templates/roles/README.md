## Using Role Definitions

When conducting a CONNECT interview or generating review outputs:

1. **Identify the employee's role/level**
2. **Read the corresponding file** from `octopus-people/Engineering/[track]/`
3. **Reference specific competencies** when discussing performance
4. **Frame feedback** in terms of role expectations
5. **Set goals** that align with the role definition

## Other Useful Context

- `octopus-people/Everyone.md` - Core values and expectations for all Octopus employees
- `octopus-people/Engineering/Levels-Maturity-And-Performance-Reviews.md` - Context on levels and reviews
- `octopus-people/Leadership.md` - Additional context for management roles

## Adding New Roles

If you need to review someone in a different role:
1. Check if it exists in `octopus-people/`
2. Note the path in this README
3. Reference it during the interview process

You don't need to copy files here - just reference them directly from `octopus-people/`.
