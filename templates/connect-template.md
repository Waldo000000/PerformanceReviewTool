# CONNECT Review Template

**PLACEHOLDER**: Manager should provide the actual CONNECT template questions.

This file should contain:
- All questions that managers need to answer in a CONNECT review
- Any specific formatting or structure requirements
- Guidance on expected length or detail level

## Template Structure (Example)

When you provide the actual template, it should clearly list all questions, such as:

1. What are this employee's key strengths?
2. What are their areas for development?
3. How have they performed against their role expectations?
4. What are their key accomplishments this period?
5. What goals should they focus on next?

(etc.)
