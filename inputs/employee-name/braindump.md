# Quick Start: Add Your Thoughts Here

This is your braindump file for capturing thoughts as you work on this employee's CONNECT review.

## How to Use This Directory

**This file (braindump.md)**: Stream-of-consciousness notes, quick captures, unpolished thoughts
**Sibling files**: Add any other materials that help with the review

Examples of what to add:
- `1-1-notes.md` - Your regular 1:1 meeting notes
- `project-notes.md` - Key projects they've worked on
- `peer-feedback.md` - Feedback from colleagues
- `achievements.md` - Notable accomplishments
- `previous-review.md` - Their last CONNECT review
- Any other files with relevant context

**File naming is flexible** - organize however works for you. Claude will read everything in this directory.

## Privacy

**Everything else in `inputs/` should be git-ignored**. None of those files should be committed to version control.
