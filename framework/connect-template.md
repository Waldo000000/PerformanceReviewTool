1. What are this employee's key strengths?
2. What are their areas for development?
3. How have they performed against their role expectations?
4. What are their key accomplishments this period?
5. What goals should they focus on next?

(etc.)

   1. \[Answer is just one of the Overall Ratings below\]  
2. What are the highlights of this person’s contribution and impact over the period? What strengths do they display?  
3. What could they focus on to grow further?  
4. Do you believe this person is ready to progress along their career path?

## Overall Rating definitions

1\. Consistent Contributor (Green)

* Definition: Consistently meeting goals and role expectations, while demonstrating the right behaviours and values.  
* Expected distribution: \~70% of the org.  
* \*Analogy: “Like imagine at school I do a math exam and I answer all the questions 100% correct. I think I have done a good job, I think I deserve an A. But I get a B. The teacher explains that A is reserved for people who go ‘above and beyond’ or are in the ‘top 10% of students in the school’. So I get a B, but don’t worry, B is good. B is kind of an A anyway. That is how our performance reviews work today — people who do A effort get Bs and don’t understand why.”

2\. Developing (Yellow) (or “On the Way” / “Growing”)

* Definition: Almost there — showing effort and progress, but not yet fully consistent in meeting goals or role expectations. May require coaching, more experience, or closer support.  
* Expected distribution: \~15–20% of the org.

3\. Needs Improvement (Red)

* Definition: Not meeting role expectations or goals. Competencies and/or behaviors require significant improvement. Often needs structured support and closer supervision.  
* Expected distribution: \~5–10% of the org.
